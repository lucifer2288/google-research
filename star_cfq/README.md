[Download the *-CFQ dataset](https://storage.cloud.google.com/star_cfq_dataset/)

The dataset and details about its construction and use are described in this
AAAI 2021 paper: [*-CFQ: Analyzing the Scalability of Machine Learning on a
Compositional Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08266).

The actual code to perform experiments described in the paper will be added
soon.
