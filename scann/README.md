# ScaNN

ScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors) is a method for efficient vector similarity
search at scale. This code release implements [1], which includes search space
pruning and quantization for Maximum Inner Product Search and also supports
other distance functions such as Euclidean distance. The implementation is
designed for x86 processors with AVX2 support. ScaNN achieves state-of-the-art
performance on [ann-benchmarks.com](http://ann-benchmarks.com) as shown on the
glove-100-angular dataset below:

ScaNN can be configured to fit datasets with different sizes and distributions.
It has both TensorFlow and Python APIs. The library shows strong performance
with large datasets [1]. The code is released for research purposes. For more
details on the academic description of algorithms, please see [1].

## Python wheels

[Python 3.5](https://storage.googleapis.com/scann/releases/1.1.0/scann-1.1.0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl)
[Python 3.6](https://storage.googleapis.com/scann/releases/1.1.0/scann-1.1.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl)
[Python 3.7](https://storage.googleapis.com/scann/releases/1.1.0/scann-1.1.0-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl)

See [docs/releases.md](docs/releases.md) for previous versions.

## Installation

See above for pre-built binaries compatible with Python 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 on
Ubuntu 16.04 or later. These binaries can be installed with `pip install <whl
name>`. **These binaries require GLIBCXX 3.4.26 or above, which are included
with GCC 9. Use your operating system's instructions to install GCC 9.**

To build ScaNN from source, first install the build tool
[bazel](https://bazel.build), Clang 8, and libstdc++ headers for C++17 (which
are provided with GCC 9). Additionally, ScaNN requires a modern version of
Python (3.5.x or later) and Tensorflow 2.1.0 installed on that version of
Python. Once these prerequisites are satisfied, run the following command in the
root directory of the repository:

```
python configure.py
CC=clang-8 bazel build -c opt --copt=-mavx2 --copt=-mfma --cxxopt="-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0" --cxxopt="-std=c++17" --copt=-fsized-deallocation --copt=-w :build_pip_pkg
./bazel-bin/build_pip_pkg
```

A .whl file should appear in the root of the repository upon successful
completion of these commands. This .whl can be installed via pip.

## Usage

See the example in [docs/example.ipynb](docs/example.ipynb). For a more in-depth
explanation of ScaNN techniques, see [docs/algorithms.md](docs/algorithms.md).
